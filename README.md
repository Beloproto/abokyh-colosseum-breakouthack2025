# abokyh-colosseum-breakouthack2025
Abokyh is a crypto-based gift card platform designed to enable seamless, affordable, and secure transactions in Francophone Africa. By building on Solana, we're looking to integrate accessible features both for users and local merchants to make their daily shop habits more easier through crypto.

# Abokyh – Solana-Powered Gift Cards for Africa

This Hackathon edition is powered by **Solana**, with features like on-chain NFTs, Solana Pay, and seamless mobile airtime/data redemption.

## Project Description

**Abokyh** allows users to (1) receive and share mobile services, (2) transact with local shops , (3) send easily some cash aborad thanks to Digital Gift Cards backed by stablecoins (like USDC on Solana). Each gift card is minted as a **non-transferable NFT** and redeemable via an on-chain process with real-world utility.

## Our idea is to Build With tools such as:

- **Solana** (L1 blockchain)
- **Anchor** (Rust-based framework for smart contracts)
- **Solana Pay** (for in-wallet payments)
- **Metaplex** (NFT minting & metadata)
- **Switchboard Oracles** (to trigger top-up APIs)
- **Next.js** (frontend app)
- **Phantom / Solflare** (wallet integrations)

## For this Hackathon and beyond, we're looking to impement these Features:

- 🔗 **Solana Pay Integration** – for easy, in-wallet gift purchases.
- 🪪 **Gift Card NFTs** – non-transferable vouchers representing mobile credit.
- 🔁 **Redemption Mechanism** – burn NFTs to trigger top-ups (via oracle/API).
